#CI/CD Pipeline with Terraform, Jenkins, AWS, and GitHub

This project demonstrates how to set up a fully automated CI/CD pipeline using Terraform, Jenkins, AWS, and GitHub for provisioning AWS infrastructure.

Overview:

This pipeline automates the provisioning of AWS resources (EC2, VPC, and S3) using Terraform, integrates with Jenkins for continuous delivery, and leverages GitHub as the version control system. Terraform state is stored in an S3 bucket to maintain infrastructure consistency.

Key Components:
Terraform: Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tool used to define and provision AWS resources.
Jenkins: Automates the CI/CD pipeline to deploy infrastructure with Terraform.
AWS: Cloud platform where EC2, VPC, and S3 are deployed.
GitHub: Source control and webhook trigger for the Jenkins pipeline.
Project Steps
Write Terraform Code:

Define AWS resources such as EC2 instances, VPC, and S3 in Terraform configuration files (main.tf).
Initialize the Terraform configuration using:
bash
Copy code
'''bash
terraform init
'''bash
Store Terraform State in S3:

Configure the backend in main.tf to store the Terraform state file in S3 for collaborative and remote state management:
hcl
Copy code
backend "s3" {
  bucket = "my-s3-bucket"
  key    = "terraform.tfstate"
  region = "ap-south-1"
}
Set Up Jenkins on EC2:

Install and configure Jenkins on an AWS EC2 instance to run automated builds and deployments.
Integrate GitHub with Jenkins:

Use webhooks in GitHub to trigger Jenkins builds when new code is pushed to the repository.
Create Jenkins Pipeline:

Add a Jenkins pipeline that runs Terraform commands (init, plan, and apply) through a Groovy script to automate the infrastructure provisioning.

Groovy Script:

groovy
Copy code
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Checkout Code') {
      steps {
        git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/your-repo.git'
      }
    }
    stage('Terraform Init') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform init'
      }
    }
    stage('Terraform Plan') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform plan'
      }
    }
    stage('Terraform Apply') {
      steps {
        sh 'terraform apply -auto-approve'
      }
    }
  }
}
Use IAM Roles for Secure Access:

Attach AWS IAM roles to Jenkins with necessary permissions (ec2fullaccess, s3fullaccess) to securely interact with AWS resources.
How to Run the Project
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
cd your-repo
Initialize and apply the Terraform configuration:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve
Trigger the Jenkins pipeline by pushing changes to GitHub.

Technologies Used
Terraform for provisioning AWS infrastructure.
Jenkins for continuous integration and delivery.
AWS (EC2, S3, VPC) for cloud infrastructure.
GitHub for version control and webhook integration.
